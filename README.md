# Lumos Website

This project centers on the redesign of a website with key pages such as blog posts, a career page, and a team page. The primary goal is to overhaul the design to align with the website's purpose, utilizing only HTML and CSS for the entire site construction. The website is responsive, offering a seamless experience across various devices, and includes a toggle between dark and light modes to cater to diverse user preferences.
